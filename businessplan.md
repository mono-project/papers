### Market-Analysis
#### Cryptocurrencies
The total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies is 113 billion US dollar, the volume of trades over the last 24 hours has been over 10 billion US dollar as well. The average market growth was 100% per year, but there has been a pump by the media which gave, and still does, a high market share. Therefore the current growth rate is not calculatable. Still, since all cryptocurrencies are not scalable, not adoptable and usually just assets, we have a huge oppurturnity in the market. Usually a cryptocurrency itself is not profitable for the develepors which means that they have to build services on top of their currency using it as a platform. While there is little to no income from this technology, development usually costs a lot. Developers have to be paid, but thats about it. Technology developed by these usually gets distributed using GitHub and promoted via twitter or special forums. That said, our greatest success factor is the scalability, adoptability and security of our tech. 
#### Shops
Over 110B US dollar worth of technology alone have been sold over 2017 and over 2300B US dollar in total, e-commerce is a huge business. The expected growth rate currently is 28%, and is expected to gradually decline to 19% per year. Our oppurtunity is very simple. We are just cheaper than everyone else. The possibility to do this has existed since forever for all the e-commerce companies, but none of them did it. Even when new competitors arrived. But we are even cheaper than the newlings, by having a total commission of 5% on top of the price we got it for. Therefore we are a whole lot less expensive and enable everyone to buy from us. The profitability is pretty high since the only thing needed is a server and an API of the market the tech got reliably bought from. The word would be shared since it's a very cheap shop. Marketing using twitter and user binding is also possible. Our key success factor is people accepting a shop that is cheaper than the products usually are on the market.
#### Exchanges
The volume of trades over the last 24 hours has been over 10 billion US dollar. Due to the previously mentioned pump, it's not possible to find a reliable market growth value. Since most exchanges charge a fee of approximately 1% per trade, our oppurturnity is it making an API available, and reducing the fees to 0.1% per trade. This will make us a lot more attractive to traders who use trading bots, since they can trade a lot more frequent and earn even more. Usually the profits are very high, the biggest exchange makes about 1 million US dollar per day with about 7% of the total 24hour value. Since the only costs are marketing, security, servers and frontend development, exchanges are not very expensive. Marketing can be done by the users since this exchange is again the cheapest. An affiliate program is possible. The key success factor for this exchange is to have a beautiful user interface which is perfectly suitable for traders but also usable by everyone.

### Assets
#### Loyalty-Bonus
To let the profits of MONO impact more than its companies wellbeing, the following partitioning is used. 60% are used to hire new employees, to have a strong expansion. 20% are used to buy back and burn coins, to increase their value. The rest (20%) is used to increase existing payments. Therefore once there are profits, payments will rise. Every wage will rise at a predefined speed, dependant on the growth of the profits. Someones "worth" is calculated by taking their current salary and dividing it by the total salaries paid over the year. This number indicates shares of the profits created in the past year. As an example on how this works, lets say we have 1'000 USD profit over the last year. Now lets assume that we have a 600:600:400:330 salary rate with four employees. We will now calculate the sum of those four salaries,which is 1930, and then calculate everyones part in it. Our set of shares will look something like this 31:31:21:17. We can now use those numbers to multiply them with the previously mentioned 20% of the profit, 1'000USD. This will mean that the new salaries will be increased by 62, 62, 42 and 34 USD, to 662, 662, 442 and 364 USD. The number of employees does not matter. New employees will get the average salary of their area of employment (e.g. web development). This way a loyalty bonus for staying with mono is enabled.

#### Milestones

* Q3 2020 > Shop
* Q4 2020 > Chat Client
* Q2 2021 > Exchange
* Q3 2021 > Social Network

#### Uservalue
Every active user has (in average) 100€ trading volume per day. We use a 0.1% fee and assume that 1% of our active users use our exchange. Hence 0.01€ per active user per day. For comparision, binance has about 150€ per active user per day. Their daily volume of 1B USD will therefore generate them about 1M USD per day.

| Name | Monthly Income per active user |
| --- | --- |
| Shop | 0.05€ |
| OnionHentai | 0.30€ |
| Exchange | 0.30€ |
| Search Engine | 0.50€ |

#### Analysis
The second year is the last year with negative money. From the then on we are able to pay the current salary with last years income. If we were bufferless, we would be able to be profitable after the first year. This is not wanted, since having a large buffer is important in a quickly changing business area.
To overcome this first depression a large funding has to be raised during an initial coin offering. Therefore the minimum amount raised in such an ICO is 660'888€.
#### Expected-Sales
The previous year generates the money used to pay expenses of the next year. Therefore there is no money in the inital two years and the second year pays for the third year.
| Year | Sales in € | Income in € | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2019 | 0 | -330'444 | Buffer of 1 year |
